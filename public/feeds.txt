# FREE RSS FEEDS (NO PAYWALL) — VERIFIED & CLEANED

*Date: 2025-09-30 (Singapore timezone).*

This file is a cleaned, annotated and (where possible) live-checked version of your original RSS list. Each row lists: **Publisher | Section | RSS URL | Status | Notes**. "Status" uses the following short codes:

* **VERIFIED (publisher)** — feed URL is explicitly listed by the publisher on their site.
* **VERIFIED (likely)** — feed follows publisher's standard URL pattern and is widely used/accepted, but the publisher blocks direct remote fetching during verification.
* **UNVERIFIED / NEEDS LIVE CHECK** — I could not confirm the feed programmatically; please run a direct HTTP check from your environment.
* **PAYWALLED / EXCLUDED** — content is typically behind a payment wall or premium subscription.
